# React Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Features

- Easy-to-understand interface: Intuitive design for seamless gameplay.
- Turn-based gameplay: Players take turns marking spaces until one wins or the game ends in a draw.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML/CSS: For structure and styling.
- GitHub: Version control and hosting.

## Usage

- Players can set their names instead of using default initials (Player1 or Player2)
- Once the game is running, players can click on empty spaces to place their marks (X or O).

- The game ends when one player wins by getting three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or when the board is full (draw).
- Players can rematch the game at the end of game clicking the "Rematch" button.
